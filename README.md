## 42-HashingAlgorithms

The MD5 and SHA256 cryptographic hashing algorithms recreated in c as part of the 42 curiculum.

# Running

use 'make' to compile. 

call `./ft_ssl` followed by either `md5` or `sha256`

you can use the following flags :

. `-p` for stdin input
. `-q` for quiet mode
. `-r` to reverse output format
. `-s` for longform output

# Enjoy !
